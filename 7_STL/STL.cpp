// 2 - using STL for unique and Non-repeating elements. 
/* If in array I need to delete the repeating elemnents and want oonly unique elements which also in 
sorted manner then it 's little bit complecated and having more complecxity, so using STL and pre defined functions */
//ðŸ“’ SET - using SET data structure we can directly store the Non-repeating and unique characters 
//ðŸ“’ VECTOR - Vector is also an array but specififcally it's an DYNAMIC ARRAY. A normal array is Static Array where size can't change for any operation of any element insertion or deletion, but in vector Array it's clearly possible 
//ðŸ“’ MAP - Easy operations like count frequesncy
//ðŸ“’ Queue -
//ðŸ“’ Stack -
