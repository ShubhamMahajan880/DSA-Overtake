Some Notes to remember forever - 

1 - return 0 is specifically uses for main function. which exit the function at the point.
2 - agr hm koi sa nya variable bnate h jo baad me use hoga code me ya loop me jese SUM,COUNT to use value 0 assign krte h taaki garbage value naa aaye
3 - return 00 ke nioche ki koi chz kabhi print nahi hogi
4 - return -1 basically indicates that element not found
5 - Pura program khatm krna ho return 0. Looping ya conditional statement end krna ho - break
6 - #include<bits/stdc++.h> - is the standard universal library file for every inbuilt library. On using it no need to use any other library. But it increase the compilation time around by 1.1 second
7 - For Pushing the all tracked changes from GitHub Repo to VS Code. in url just use 1s after github and before .com
8 - remember some of the ASCII Values - 	A-Z :- 65-90, a-z :- 97-122, 0-9 :- 48-57
9 - in string for get the int from ASCII Value - substract '0' OR 48
9.1 - //ðŸ“Œ Logic - For making first letter capital of given small case string , simple substract the no. 32 which is ASCII Value difference of a-A : 97-65 = 32. and applicable for all the alphabets
9.2 - From Capital to Small - Add 32. 
10 - IF Time Complexity is > than 10^7, then not run in  1 sec.
11 - Void function do not return anything.
