Some Notes to remember forever - 

1 - return 0 is specifically uses for main function.
2 - agr hm koi sa nya variable bnate h jo baad me use hoga code me ya loop me jese SUM,COUNT to use value 0 assign krte h taaki garbage value naa aaye
3 - return 00 ke nioche ki koi chz kabhi print nahi hogi
4 - return -1 basically indicates that element not found
5 - Pura program khatm krna ho return 0. Looping ya conditional statement end krna ho - break
6 - #include<bits/stdc++.h> - is the standard universal library file for every inbuilt library. On using it no need to use any other library. But it increase the compilation time around by 1.1 second
